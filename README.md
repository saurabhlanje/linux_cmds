   You can access an argument inside a script using the variables $1, $2, $3, and so on. The variable $1 refers to the first argument, $2 to the second argument, and $3 to the third argument. So, in this case, since we only have 1 argument, we access it using the variable $1.
   the value of the argument is assgined to the variable $ARG1

  The .bashrc file is a special bash script, which Linux executes whenever a new Shell session is initialized.
  
  In simple terms, environment variables are set when you open a new shell session. at any time if you change any of the variable values, the shell has no way of picking that change. The export command, on the other hand, provides the ability to update the current shell session about the change you made to the exported variable. You donâ€™t have to wait until new shell session to use the value of the variable you changed.
